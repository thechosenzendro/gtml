# What is GTML?
Simply, GTML (Gnome Toolkit Markup Language) is a language and a compiler for building user interfaces with an easy to understand syntax.
## Main features
- 💡 Easy to understand - tags, attributes, nesting. Things that almost any developer knows well.
- 🐍 Uses & compiles to python - the most used language in the world!
- 📚 Uses XML for the markup - it is eXtensible. And that is cool.
- 🧩 Extensible with custom components - you can define custom components, attributes, even possible values for them!
- 🧲 Easy data binding - under the hood, it uses f""" string for every text, so you can bind variables just like this: {variable}!
- ⛔ Helpful error messages - I promise it is better than C++.
## Documentation
The documentation is going to be added soon.
